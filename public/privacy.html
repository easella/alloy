<p>
Your privacy is very important to us. Ontheroadtovote.com (	&#34;Road to Vote	&#34;) we have a few fundamental principles which guide our privacy policy:
 
 We do not ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
 
 We do not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop, maintain and provide our services and products, or protect our rights.
 
 We do not store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our service.
 
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.
 
Your use of the Road to Vote website constitutes your acceptance of this privacy policy.
 
This privacy policy is effective June __, 2021.</p>
<h1>
Website visitors</h1>
 <p>
Like many website operators, Road to Vote collects and analyzes non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Similarly, we also collect visitor Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses are potentially personally-identifying. We treat them the way we treat personally-identifying information.
 
Road to Vote collects the information described in the preceding paragraph (&#34;Visitor Information&#34;) to understand how Road to Vote’s visitors use its website and/or to target/measure the response to advertisements we may run. We may use the services of third-parties such as Roxr Software Ltd (Clicky), Google (Google Analytics) and Twitter (each a &#34;Data Provider&#34;) to help us collect and analyze Visitor Information. (Click on the links for privacy policies/more information including how to opt out).</p>
 <h1>
Gathering of personally-identifying information</h1>
 <p>
Certain visitors to Road to Vote’s websites choose to interact with Road to Vote in ways that require Road to Vote to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Road to Vote gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask each visitor who contacts us to provide an email address and, optionally, a name. We also request an email address, name and other information from each visitor who wishes to receive our email updates. Moreover visitors who participate in polls conducted by Road to Vote or on Road to Vote’s behalf, are asked to provide certain information that may include age, gender, urban, suburban or rural residence, etc. In each case, Road to Vote collects this information only as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Road to Vote. In addition, you can sign up for our emails without disclosing anything other than your email address.  It’s completely up to you.
 
Road to Vote does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always decline to supply personally-identifying information, including by activating their web browser’s “do not track” function, with the understanding that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
 <h1>
Aggregated statistics
</h1>
 <p>
Road to Vote may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Road to Vote may monitor the most popular pages on the website. Road to Vote may display this information publicly or provide it to others. For example,  Road to Vote may release aggregated, non-personally-identifying information by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
 
However, Road to Vote does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
 <h1>
Protection of certain personally-identifying information</h1>
 <p>
Road to Vote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Road to Vote’s behalf or to provide services or products available on Road to Vote’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Road to Vote’s websites, you consent to the transfer of this information to them. Road to Vote will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Road to Vote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Road to Vote believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Road to Vote, third parties or the public at large. Road to Vote takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
 <h1>
Cookies
</h1>
 <p>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Road to Vote uses cookies to help Road to Vote identify and track visitors, their usage of the Road to Vote website, and their website access preferences.
 
Road to Vote visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Road to Vote’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Road to Vote’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Except for certain Data Provider cookies, the Road to Vote website currently does not allow for third-party cookies (i.e., cookies from a domain other than Road to Vote.com). Cookies may be used by Data Providers to identify unique visitors. In the case of Clicky, a third-party &#34;Unique ID&#34; tracking cookie is used for the &#34;legitimate purpose&#34; of identifying unique visitors, but otherwise no &#34;personal data&#34; is logged.</p>
 <h1>
Business transfers
</h1>
 <p>
If Road to Vote, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Road to Vote goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that might be transferred or acquired by a third party.  You acknowledge that these transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Road to Vote may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
 <h1>
Ads
</h1>
 <p>
Currently, Road to Vote’s website is ad free, and we have no present intention of changing this policy. If we change this policy in the future, we will modify this privacy policy accordingly.</p>
 <h1>
Comments
</h1>
 <p>
Comments and other content submitted to our anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives or missed spam, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives and missed spam.
</p>
 <h1>
Third-party service providers
</h1>
 <p>
Email updates we may provide will be processed by an unaffiliated service provider. To the extent necessary for it to provide this processing, our service providers will gather or be aware of your Personally-Identifying Information. When selecting a service provider Road to Vote seeks to assure (by reviewing the service provider’s privacy policy) that the service provider will handle Personally-Identifying Information in a secure manner, but cannot make guarantees in this regard.
